# Pysistant 

A package of utility functions that are designed to help me during my time at school. 
And also for familiarizing myself more with the Python programming language as well as
its various libraries and packages.

## Package Structure

The package structure is as follows. I will do my best to keep things up to date on a weekly basis as I work on this side-project during my limited downtime.

```
