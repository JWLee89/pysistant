    A simple utility fo handling files that I am working on
    as needs occur. Code will be added depending on what kind of needs
    I come across during the course of projects and classes.
    Primarily also for a way for me to get used to Python.

    TODO: Change architecture so that there are only import statements
    under __init__.py
